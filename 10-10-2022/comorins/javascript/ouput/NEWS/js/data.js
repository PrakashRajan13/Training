The case has shed spotlight on similar incidents in India, where murders carried out in the name of superstition, or ‘black magic’ rituals are not uncommon. In October this year itself, two men were arrested for allegedly killing a six-year-old boy, in what they claimed was a “sacrifice for prosperity”, at the construction site of the CRPF headquarters in South Delhi’s Lodhi Colony. And in May, a man allegedly beheaded his 60-year-old maternal uncle over black magic suspicion and walked around two kilometers with his severed head and axe in hands in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh before being nabbed by the police. Black magic crimes and other superstitious offences violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by Indian Constitution Articles 14, 15, and 21. These acts also violate several international treaties, including the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights,' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,' and “Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,' to which India is a signatory.'",

The circumstances under which the chief minister took the decision are quite interesting. The political expediency arose from the fact that Congress’s Rahul Gandhi at the party’s Bharat Jodo Yatra spoke about implementing the Justice Nagamohan Das Commission report on widening reservations for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The very next day, Karnataka’s leader of the opposition and former chief minister Siddaramaiah had to leave the yatra to attend the all-party meeting called to decide on increasing reservations. Shortly afterwards, the Bommai cabinet accepted the recommendations of the Justice Das-led commission, which had been set up by the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition when it was in power in 2018-19. The panel submitted its report in July 2020 which recommended increasing reservations for SC and STs.",

So, you might be living in a tier-1 or a tier-2 city, and your telecom operator also must have rolled out 5G services, but you also need to ask yourself a question - is 5G available to use in your area? For instance, youve bought yourself an expensive flagship phone, just to experience the superfast 5G speeds, only to know that 5G services arent available to use in your area. And say, your area is supposed to get 5G support in a year or two, what do you then? Did you buy this expensive phone to experience 5G one year down the line?!",
